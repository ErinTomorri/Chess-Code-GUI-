Hello, welcome to the test run of our new version of chess with your host ERIN TOMORRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
The game is unlike your regular chess game, the pieces still move in your regular patterns: 
The bishop (Josh) moves in a diagonal patterns
The knight (Vincent) moves two squares horizontally or vertically and then one square vertically or horizontally
The rook (Tolga) moves horizontally or vertically across the whole board
The queen (Allen) moves horizontally, vertically or diagonal across the whole board
The king (Philip) moves horizontally, vertically or diagonal one square
The pawn (Samuel) moves foward one or two squares intially and then one square every instance after that and can attack a peice diagonally 
The white pieces start and then they alternate
The new features added to the game are mindblowing:
    - You need to capture all of your opponents pieces 
    - THERE IS NO OBJECT COLLISION & THERE IS NO CASTLING OR EN PASSANT (intentionally done) (explained why in my write up)
